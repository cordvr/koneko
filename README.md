## Evasion Techniques

Koneko employs several advanced evasion techniques to help you stay under the radar. Here are a few:

- **Obfuscation**: The shellcode is obfuscated to make it harder for security tools to detect.
- **Dynamic Loading**: Load components dynamically to evade static analysis.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt payloads to prevent signature-based detection.
- **Timing Manipulation**: Introduce delays to avoid triggering behavioral detection systems.

These techniques work together to provide a stealthy approach to security testing.
